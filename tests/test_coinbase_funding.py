"""Channels funded by a coinbase output.

A miner can pay a block reward straight into a channel's 2-of-2 funding
script. The coinbase transaction is then the funding transaction: nothing is
broadcast, nothing has to relay, and the block itself creates the channel.

We cannot be the funder of one, because libwally cannot represent a coinbase
input in a version 2 PSBT, and that is what the first test pins down. We can
still be asked to be the fundee, and we refuse: the channel is forgotten the
moment its funding is found at transaction 0 of a block.
